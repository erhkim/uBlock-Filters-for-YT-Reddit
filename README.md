# uBlock-Filters-for-YT-Reddit

## Reddit (old):

Removes: ALL/RANDOM links in the top bar, the premium ad, the sidebar on the left, the footer, and something else can't remember.

## YT:

Removes: Home screen content, Trending tabs

## Why:

To prevent exposure to low-quality, emotionally manipulative content without disabling core functionality of those sites.
